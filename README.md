# Consultancy Services â€” Enhanced Interactive Website

This package contains the enhanced interactive version of the website. It uses high-quality stock images hosted via Unsplash, interactive carousel, counters, AJAX contact form (Formspree), and a fresh modern color scheme.

## Deploy
Upload all files to your GitHub repo (overwrite existing files) and enable GitHub Pages as before.

## Images
Images are referenced by Unsplash URLs; you can replace them by saving local images into an `images/` folder and updating the `src` attributes.

## Form
The contact form is already connected to the Formspree endpoint you provided (https://formspree.io/f/mqalwlkv). No further changes required unless you want to change the endpoint.
